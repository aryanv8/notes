# Secret / Esoteric Orders & Organizations (Spoiler-Moderate)

This document lists notable (or hinted) clandestine families, cults, sects, or organizations relevant up to the currently released anime episodes (through Episode 8: "Losing Control"). It focuses on: (1) Name, (2) Epoch of prominence/origin, (3) Deity / Entity / Ideal venerated, (4) Dominant Pathway(s) cultivated.

Epoch Key (simplified, spoiler‑light):
- First–Second Epochs: Mythic / Primordial eras (largely lost to history)
- Third Epoch: Age of Blood Empire / high ritual mysticism
- Fourth Epoch: Transitional, decline of prior hegemonies; secret families fracture
- Fifth Epoch: Current Steam & Machinery era (anime setting)

| # | Name / Designation | Epoch (Origin or Peak) | Worshipped Entity / Core Object of Reverence | Dominant Pathway(s) Among Followers | Concise Notes (Spoiler‑Moderate) |
|---|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1 | Antigonus Family | Late Third → Fourth (collapsed before late Fifth) | (Lost) Esoteric focus tied to remnants associated with the "Fool" domain (NOT a public church) | Seer (Fool Pathway) core; ancillary ritual studies | Once a high‑sequence mystical bloodline guarding a critical notebook; destruction scattered key artifacts. Central to early plot catalyst (the notebook Klein acquires). |
| 2 | Nighthawks (Evernight Church field team) | Fifth (modern) | Evernight Goddess | Darkness (Sleepless Pathway) primary; support from Seer-adjacent diviners | Official, semi‑public special operations squad handling Beyonder incidents, investigation, suppression, purification. Klein serves here early. |
| 3 | Church of the Evernight Goddess (broader hierarchy) | Late Fourth formation → Fifth dominance | Evernight Goddess | Darkness (Sleepless); auxiliary: Seer (Fool) for divination; Visionary (Spectator) in specialized clergy | Major orthodox church; provides structured advancement; emphasizes restraint against loss of control. |
| 4 | Church of the Lord of Storms | Fifth (modern maritime expansion) | Lord of Storms | Tyrant (Sailor) Pathway | Martial, zealous, sea‑dominated orthodoxy; emphasizes direct confrontation and force; intersects with port investigations. |
| 5 | Demoness Sect (aka Demoness Cult) | Pre‑Fifth roots; active underground in Fifth | (Occult feminine archetype / higher hidden entity; details unrevealed in anime timeframe) | Demoness (Assassin Pathway) | Secretive, uses infiltration & identity subversion; feared for precise assassinations and emotional manipulation. Early hints only. |
| 6 | Aurora Order (Whispers / fringe references) | Fourth remnants → Fifth clandestine resurgence | The True Creator (title; identity opaque) | Abyss (Prisoner) & corruption‑leaning offshoots; occasional Demoness integration | Radical millenarian cult seeking transformative upheaval. Only oblique foreshadowing so far; doctrine withheld. |
| 7 | Abraham Family (Fragmented arcane lineage) | Third → Fourth; diminished Fifth | (No formal worship; lineage curates spatial/arcane heritage) | Door (Apprentice) Pathway | Historic family safeguarding spatial mysticism; scattered descendants; artifacts / knowledge surface intermittently. |
| 8 | Life School of Thought (scholarly circle) | Fifth intellectual movement (derives from older naturalist traditions) | Philosophical veneration of life cycles (not a deity) | Mother (Planter) Pathway; Moon (Apothecary) collaboration | Semi‑academic; advances bio‑alchemical understanding, cultivation ethics, ecological experimentation. Peripheral hints only. |
| 9 | Spiritual Order (Death‑oriented custodians) | Fourth → Fifth | Abstraction of Death principle / sanctioned funerary mysteries | Death (Corpse Collector) Pathway | Oversees remains, spirit rites, undead containment. Limited on‑screen presence (background world‑building). |
|10 | Demon Hunter Circles (generic Hunter consortium cells) | Fifth (professionalized) | No deity; pragmatic monster‑suppression charter | Hunter Pathway | Ad‑hoc or licensed groups focusing on track / neutralize / recover operations; coordinate with church teams. |
|11 | Rose School of Thought (aka “Rose School”) | Fourth clandestine formation → Fifth covert activity | (Masked) veneration of a corrupt life / desire source; public façade of “higher life evolution” | Mother (Planter) core; Demoness (Assassin) & Moon (Apothecary) auxiliaries for infiltration / biotransmutation | Extremist esoteric cabal twisting botanical & reproductive mysticism into aberrant synthesis experiments. Employs cultivated hosts, parasitic growth, layered infiltration. Anime reference so far is name‑drop / atmospheric; deeper hierarchy & patron identity not explicit on‑screen yet (kept vague to avoid novel spoilers). |

Notes:
- Table intentionally omits deep higher‑sequence cosmology and true identities behind certain entities to stay spoiler‑moderate.
- "Dominant Pathway(s)" lists those most culturally or operationally central; ancillary Pathways may appear for support (divination, intelligence, logistics).
- Some names (e.g., Aurora Order deeper doctrine, Antigonus legacy, Rose School patron specifics) will gain clearer definition after more episodes; wording kept broad.
- Future updates: Expand when an organization receives an on‑screen exposition scene (add hallmark abilities, structural tiers, signature artifacts) while retaining spoiler gating for novel‑only revelations.

Update Strategy:
- When an organization advances from mere mention to active plot engagement, enrich its row (capabilities, modus operandi) without revealing unrevealed patron identities.
