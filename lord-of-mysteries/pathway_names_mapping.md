# Pathway Names Mapping

## Introduction

In "Lord of the Mysteries," Pathways are supernatural systems that allow individuals to gain extraordinary abilities through a sequence of potions and advancement. Each Pathway has two types of names:

- **Common Names**: These are the widely known names used in everyday conversation, often referring to the profession or role associated with the Pathway.
- **Tarot Names**: These are the secret, true names of the Pathways, based on Tarot card arcana. These names represent the deeper mystical nature of each Pathway.

The distinction between these naming conventions becomes apparent early in the series, where practitioners often use common names in public while the true Tarot-based names hold deeper significance in mystical circles.
