# Pathway Names Mapping

## Introduction

In "Lord of the Mysteries," Pathways are supernatural progression systems that allow individuals to gain extraordinary abilities through consuming potions and advancing through sequences (from Sequence 9 to Sequence 0). Each Pathway has two types of names:

- **Common Names**: These are the widely known names used in everyday conversation by Beyonders and ordinary people. They often refer to the profession, role, or general characteristics associated with the starting sequence of the Pathway.
- **Tarot Names**: These are the secret, true names of the Pathways, based on the 22 Major Arcana of Tarot cards. These names represent the deeper mystical nature and ultimate destination of each Pathway, often known only to high-sequence Beyonders and those with deep mystical knowledge.

The distinction between these naming conventions becomes apparent early in the series, where practitioners often use common names in public while the true Tarot-based names hold deeper significance in mystical circles and are crucial for understanding the fundamental nature of each path of power.
